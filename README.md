## Earth Buildplate Editor
*A simple tool to edit Minecraft Earth's buildplate format.

Currently very early, and much spagetti code

### Notes
-  To get the resources, youl need to get your hands on a copy of Minecraft Earth's resouce pack and make some modifications. Copyright prohibits distribution.
- .plate is the unencrypted json of the Minecraft Earth tile format. .plate64 is this data with base64 encryption, as this is what the Minecraft Earth server uses
